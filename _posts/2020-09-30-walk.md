Wed Sep 30 07:21:32 EDT 2020 : Walked woods from Borders to Politis, 6:50 to 7:20.  
Cool, 53 degrees and wet, as it rained hard most of the day yesterday and again during the night.  
The creek was high, but not full, and certainly not flood, but there were signs that it got full yesterday.  
Some standing water on the trail, a few places where the dark colored leaves and dirt had been washed away from the trail, exposing the bright clay beneath.  
Sky was partly cloudy, with early morning sun lighting cummulus clouds pink and white, which I enjoy.  
There was also that irregular effect when a thin, dark layer of clouds is moving quickly far below the bright clouds.  
I smelled wood smoke just for a few yards short of Renzetti's, but then not again.
