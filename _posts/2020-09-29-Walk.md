07:20:24 EDT 2020 : Walked in the woods from Borders to Politis. Everything soaking wet like a great damp sponge. Lots of trees down, not fresh, but from the summer storms. Leaves not turning yet, maybe 3%. The euonymous in the yard is starting to turn red. It's maybe 15%. Saw two women walking dogs, both on leashes. One Husky. Saw Warren Rosencrantz across the mall. Inn Lane, Connie and Russ's house, Trump yardsign gauntlet with lady on her porch watching me every step. Some crows, warm, I wore a mask. The creek was medium-low, no wind.
