[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/prot/) problem asks:

> **Given**: An RNA string s corresponding to a strand of mRNA (of length at most 10 kbp).

> **Return**: The protein string encoded by s.

# Restate the problem
They're going to send me a file with an RNA string in it. I need to return the protein sequence that RNA string codes for.

# Solution steps
First, I did [some reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code#RNA_codon_table) to learn about the RNA Codon table and how every three base-pairs in an RNA string work together to make a codon which translates to a protein.

[This](https://biopython.org/docs/latest/api/Bio.Seq.html#Bio.Seq.SequenceDataAbstractBaseClass.translate) function in the Bio.Seq module sounds like it should do the trick.

I found the specifics of how to work with Bio.Seq.translate() [here](https://biopython.org/docs/latest/api/Bio.Seq.html#Bio.Seq.translate).

Bio.Seq.translate() uses an asterisk as the stop symbol by default, but there's a parameter, stop_symbol, that I can set to '' to omit the asterisk.

My full solution code is [here](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/prot.py).

# Problem-solvingconcepts
Finding the right function in biopython was the only step in solving this problem. Reading the RNA string was done with code I had written for previous challenges, and it only took two lines to pass the RNA string to the translator and handle the results:
```python
def prot(file_path):
    seq = Seq(read_rna_sequence(file_path))
    return str(seq.translate(stop_symbol=''))
```
