[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Two DNA strings s and t of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).

> **Return**: The Hamming distance dH(s,t).

# First impression
This looks simple. I just go through the two DNA strings they give me and count how many places those two strings differ.

# Solution steps
This turned out to be as simple as it looked. I wrote [the code](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/hamm.py) in one pass and got the correct answer on the first attempt.

# Conclusion
I don't learn much from the easy ones.

Looking through the solutions from others online, I see some clever [Pythonic](https://blog.startifact.com/posts/what-is-pythonic/) tricks to do this more simply than I did.

The [Wikipedia entry for Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) is interesting and includes Python code for calculating the Hamming distance for two strings.
The example they give isn't very different from the code I wrote.

[Richard Hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) led a fascinating life.
