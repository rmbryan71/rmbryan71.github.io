[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Two DNA strings s and t of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).

> **Return**: The Hamming distance dH(s,t).

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get two DNA strings **of equal length**, and I need to return a count of the places where those two strings are different.

# Solution steps
This turned out to be as simple as it first looked, which is not usually so. I wrote [the code](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/hamm.py) in one pass and got the correct answer on the first attempt.

# Python concepts
Looking through the solutions from others online, I see some clever [Pythonic](https://blog.startifact.com/posts/what-is-pythonic/) tricks to do this more simply than I did it, including many [one-liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-liner_program).

# Bioinformatics concepts

The [Wikipedia entry for Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) is interesting and includes Python code for calculating the Hamming distance for two strings.
The example they give isn't very different from the code I wrote.

[Richard Hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) led a fascinating life.

[Here](https://www.notion.com/blog/a-roundtable-on-richard-hamming) is a fascinating roundtable discussion about his impact on the history of mathmatics.
