Sat Oct  3 08:54:05 EDT 2020 : Arden woods Borders to Politis, 8:30 to 8:50 AM, 90 minutes after sunrise.  
Bright sun, clear, cold, 46 degrees, slight breeze.  Beautiful day.  
With daylight, the leaves look closer to 8% turned now. The dim morning is maybe not the best time to observe the leaves.  
Hiking later in the morning is a bit like being in a completely different place.  Saw two dead voles, one on the walkway in our yard, the other on the road in front of Borders. Both were directly in the center of the path, as if placed there.  I didn't see obvious signs of trauma on either.  
I took a [picture](/assets/images/IMG_20201003_084540982.jpg) with my cellphone, and I'll experiment by trying to link it here.
