Thu Oct  1 07:17:01 EDT 2020 : Started walking 6:35. Twilight today is 6:31, Sunrise is 6:58.  
Light was dim, but walkable on the street. In the few minutes it took me to walk to Appletree and Hilltop, it was light enough to walk down into the glen, over the bridge and down to the creek.  
Between the low light, slow going because of rocks, and wondering if there might be homeless people living in that section of the woods these days, my blood got going a bit. That section of the trail is wild and rough. Many fallen trees, lots of washout, places where the trail isn't clear, uneasy footing. It's much more of a challenge than the sections farther up stream.  
58 degrees, mostly clear skies, no wind, damp ground, but not wet.  
Leaves maybe 3% turning. One place downstream had noticable yellow in the green of the leaves, but many places still look full green.
