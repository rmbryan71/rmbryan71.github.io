# Restate the problem
Given two protein strings, I need to find the minimum number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions required to transform the first string into the second string.

# Solution steps
First, I decided to try to implement the pseudocode definition of the Wagner-Fischer algorithm from Wikipedia.

After struggling to properly create and fill a two-dimensional array using native Python nested lists, I decided to install NumPy and use NumPy arrays which are easier for me to work with. 

There were some stubborn indexing issues that took a while to work out with trial and error. The description of the Wagner-Fischer algorithm on Wikipedia has the input strings one-indexed and the matrix zero-indexed, which took me a while to implement correctly in Python, which zero-indexes everything by default.

Once the indexing issues were fixed, I got correct responses for the sample dataset on Project Rosalind as well as the example on Wikipedia.

I got a correct response on the first attempt at real data. The two strings I was given were 863 and 797 characters long. 392 edits were required to transform the first string into the second string.

# Python concepts
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) describes itself as "The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python". It's a massive set of tools that comes with tons of great documentation and examples. I like using their arrays because they support [indexing I understand](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.html).
