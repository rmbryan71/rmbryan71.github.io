# Restate the problem
I need to find the least number of steps required to transform one 10-digit string into another 10-digit string when each step is a reversal of a contiguous subset of the changing string.

The hint given with the challenge is: 
> "Don't be afraid to try an ugly solution."

# Solution steps
First, encouraged by the hint about ugly being acceptable, I tried randomly reversing contiguous subset of strings until I stumbled into to the correct order, but that took forever and was never guaranteed to find the shortest path, so I gave up on that quickly as a waste of time.

Then, after failing to come up with an original approach on my own, I went searching online and found [Euna Park's paper](https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/etd_projects/104/), which outlines what she proposes to be an optimal solution to this problem.

Even after reading the paper twice and investing several hours in coding out the algorithm in python, I did not make any substantial progress until I read 
[this article](https://medium.com/@matthewwestmk/calculating-reversal-distance-using-parks-exact-greedy-algorithm-87c62d690eef) by Matt West.

I wrote [my solution](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/rear.py) while referring to West's code.
