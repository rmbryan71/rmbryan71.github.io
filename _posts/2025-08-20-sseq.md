[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/sseq/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Two DNA strings s and t.

> **Return**: One collection of indices of s in which the symbols of t appear as a subsequence of s.

<!--break-->

# Required reading
1. [Subsequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence)
2. [Sting find](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_find.asp)

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get two DNA strings, and I need to return a list of indexes for the first string that map to the characters in the second string.

# Solution steps
I looped through the smaller string, using string.find() to return the index of each corresponding character in the longer string, then printed those index values to the console.
