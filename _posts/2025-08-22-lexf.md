[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/lexf/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A collection of at most 10 symbols defining an ordered alphabet, and a positive integer n (nâ‰¤10).

> **Return**: All strings of length n that can be formed from the alphabet, ordered lexicographically

<!--break-->

# Required reading
1. [Lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order)
2. [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)
3. [itertools.product](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product)

# Restate the problem
This challenge can be simplified by substituting the word "Alphabetical" for "Lexicographical". In this case, they mean the same thing.

I'm going to get a set of letters in alphabetical order, and a number less than or equal to 10. I need to return all the possible n-length strings that I can make from the original set of letters, in alphabetical order.

# Solution steps
First, I decided that itertools is a general-enough library that using it is fair game for Project Rosalind.

As a result, the solution was:
```python
def lexf(A, n):
    for x in itertools.product(A, repeat = n):
        print(str(''.join(x)), end = '\n')
```

# Python concepts
Working with itertools was the only new element in this challenge. 

# Bioinformatics concepts
This challenge didn't have much to do with bioinformatics, except that the introduction mentions that it's good form to list [genetic strings](https://rosalind.info/glossary/genetic-string/) in alphabetical order.
