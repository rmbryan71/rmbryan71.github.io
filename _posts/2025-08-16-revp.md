[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/revp/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A DNA string of length at most 1 kbp in FASTA format.

> **Return**: The position and length of every reverse palindrome in the string having length between 4 and 12.

# Restate the problem
Introductory reading:
1. [Reverse palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_sequence) x2
2. [Reverse complement](https://rosalind.info/glossary/reverse-complement/)


# Solution steps
My first thought was to write a function to find all reverse palindromes of length 4.

That worked, and when I expanded it to search for palindromes of various length, it seemed to work for longer palindromes as well.

I got my code to process the sample dataset correctly, but kept failing on the challenge datasets, and for the longest time, I couldn't figure out why.

Finally, I figured out that the files Project Rosalind was sending me included line breaks in the DNA sequences, which was new, and my code wasn't handling them properly.

# Python concepts
Reading the DNA string out of the file directly failed because of the line breaks, but SeqIO.parse worked fine.

# Bioinformatics concepts
This challenge built on the previous bioinformatics concepts of reverse palindromes and complements.
