Sat Oct  3 19:17:20 EDT 2020 : Katie and I went on a Delaware Nature Society canoe trip on the Christina river from the boat launch on Churchman's Marsh Road. The weather was magnificent. Clear blue skies, light wind, a little warm to start, a little cool once the sun started going down.  The trees were maybe 10% turned, vibrant, active colors, and the creek was calm, we went at a nice pace and had plenty of time to savor being out on a nice day before the long winter.  

We saw a red-shouldered hawk soaring effortlessly above the marsh, a thousand red-winged blackbirds, a few baltimore orioles, some wild rice, and just thoroughly enjoyed being out there.
