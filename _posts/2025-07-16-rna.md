title:  "Transcribing DNA into RNA"

[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/rna/) problem asks:
> **Given**: A DNA string t having length at most 1000 nt.

> **Return**: The transcribed RNA string of t
## First impression
They're going to send me a relatively small file and all I have to do is replace each "T" with a "U".
This might even be easier than [Counting DNA Neucleotides](../_posts/2025-07-15-counting-DNA-neucleotides.md).

## Solution steps
Python has a built-in function called [replace()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp) that does exactly what this problem calls for.

Alternatively, we could do this in any word processor. Just find every instance of "T" and replace with "U".
## Conclusion
This didn't involve much problem-solving. Trust me, they get more interesting.
