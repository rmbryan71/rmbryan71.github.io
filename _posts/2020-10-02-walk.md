Fri Oct  2 07:07:57 EDT 2020 : 54 degrees, steady rain, sky dark and cloudy.  
Low light too dim for walking in the woods at 6:35, so I went on the streets upstream to Ann's.  
By the time I got there, it was still too dark for trail walking, but I went anyway.  
Those minutes, so much happens with the rising light. The rain adds energy to the transition.  
I stood at the sandy bend and just watched it all for a few moments in awe.  

Black walnuts that have fallen and softened for a few days, now wet, perform an amazing unraveling when kicked. While they roll, their outer husks disintegrate, spinning off like shirts from overheated children running into the bay. Magically, they gain speed as they go. Free from the burden of protective padding, the hard nutshell inside bounces on down the street, launched, headed for a destiny the spent casing left behind will never know.
