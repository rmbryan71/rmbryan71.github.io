[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/subs/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Two DNA strings s and t (each of length at most 1 kbp).

> **Return**: All locations of t as a substring of s.

# Restate the problem
Things I read before restating the problem:
1. [Motifs](https://rosalind.info/glossary/motif/)
2. [Substrings](https://rosalind.info/glossary/substring/)

They're going to send me two DNA strings. I need to return every location in _s_ that begins an instance of the string _t_ appearing inside _s_.

# Solution steps
First, I wrote an algorithm that steps through _s_ and checks to see if it's a match for the first character in _t_.

Then, I looked up the many functions and methods associated with [slicing strings in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp).

I spent some time going down an unhelpful path using nested for statements before I realized that instead of just checking if the first character was a match, I could check for the whole substring at once with:
> if (s[i:i+len(t)]) == t:

# Python concepts
The history of [Array slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_slicing) goes all the way back to 1957, with [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran). It's important to remember that Python always begins counting at zero.

I needed to [strip](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_strip.asp) the inputs because they came from Project Rosalind with trailing spaces, which prevented them from finding substrings.

# Bioinformatics concepts
The Biopython library includes [methods to find motifs](https://biopython.org/docs/latest/Tutorial/chapter_motifs.html) in DNA sequences, and it's worth looking at [the source code](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/master/Bio/motifs/__init__.py) to see how they do it differently.

There's also a clear and concise summary of DNA motifs [here](https://open.oregonstate.education/appliedbioinformatics/chapter/chapter-2-sequence-motifs/).
