[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/gc/) problem asks:

> **Given**: At most 10 DNA strings in FASTA format (of length at most 1 kbp each).

> **Return**: The ID of the string having the highest GC-content, followed by the GC-content of that string.

# First impression
Before I could start on this challenge, I needed to read this to learn all about 
[how the FASTA file format works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format).

I found the [Bio.SeqUtils.GC function](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.html#Bio.SeqUtils.GC) that returns
the G+C content for a sequence, which seemed like a good fit.

# Not so fast
Although I have the latest version of the biopython library installed, I was not able to:
```aiignore
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
```
because there is no GC function in the Bio.SeqUtils library, despite [the documentation](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.html#Bio.SeqUtils.GC) saying there is.

I went to the [Bio.SeqUtils repository on GitHub](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/master/Bio/SeqUtils/__init__.py) 
and saw that the function has been renamed to gc_fraction.

# String formatting in Python
Having the gc_fraction function made this challenge easy, but I struggled to convert the highest gc_fraction to a string
so that I could save it in my solution file.

Then I learned about all the new methods for [string formatting in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_string_formatting.asp).

The trick, as you can see in [my code](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/gc.py), is to use:
```aiignore
solution = GCname + '\n' + '%f' % GCmax
```

# Conclusion
I learned several important lessons in this challenge:
* how to work with FASTA files using the SeqIO.parse function
* how to look through the source code for biopython in GitHub
* how to format floats into strings in Python versions 3.6 and later

I also reminded myself how to use [list comprehension](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp) in Python
so that I could write:
```aiignore
for record in SeqIO.parse(file, "fasta"):
```
