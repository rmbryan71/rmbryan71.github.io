[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/sset/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A positive integer _n_ (_n_≤1000).

> **Return**: The total number of subsets of {1,2,…,_n_} modulo 1,000,000.

<!--break-->

# Required reading
1. [Number of subsets in a set](https://mathmonks.com/sets/subset)
2. [Modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo)

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get a positive integer, _n_, less than 1000. I need to return the number of subsets of counting numbers up to and including _n_.

# Solution steps
Since the number of subsets for any set with n elements is 2**_n_, the solution to this challenge is:

```python
print((2**n)%1000000)
```

where _n_ is the integer received from Project Rosalind.

** is the Python operator for exponentiation, so 2**_n_ in Python means 2 to the *n*th power.

My full code is:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = "/Users/robertbryan/Downloads/rosalind_sset.txt"
    file = open(file_path, "r").readline()
    n = int(file)
    print((2**n)%1000000)
```

Because 2**_n_ becomes awkwardly large for modest values of _n_, we return our response modulo 1,000,000 to prove that we have calculated the answer correctly without having to transmit excessively large values.

For example, the _n_ I received from Project Rosalind for my challenge dataset was 935. My response modulo 1,000,000 was 690368, which is relatively easy to deal with.

The full value of 2**935 has 282 decimal digits. For comparison, I've included it below as an appendix.

My first response was correct. This challenge took about 15 minutes. 2,989 people solved this before me. I was the second person to solve this on August 10, 2025. Almost all solvers used 2**n to calculate the answer to this challenge. A few others tried generating all the possible subsets, then counting them. That approach leads to timing struggles because it is so inefficient.
