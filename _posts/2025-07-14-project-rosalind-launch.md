# Me
Hi, I'm Rob. I'm a [technical writer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmbryan/) in the process of working the 
[Project Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/about/) set of bioinformatics problems. I'll be documenting the process here.
For each problem in Project Rosalind, I'll post about the key points on my path to a solution as well as the bioinformatics and python concepts
I learn along the way.

# Ground rules
1. **AI Use**: I'm not going to use any AI tools for this project because I'm doing this to learn and write about what I learn.
2. **Posting Code**: I'm sharing my code repository [here](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind) so that you can see my solutions in detail.
3. **Programming Language**: [Python](https://www.python.org/).

# Getting started
I solved 37 of these problems back in 2018. I'll be re-working those and writing blog posts about them. 

Then, I'll move on to solving new problems and writing about them.
You can see my [progress](https://rosalind.info/users/rmbryan/) toward solving all of the problems. 

# Who is this for?

* a hiring manager or HR professional looking to recruit a technical writer
* a technical writer who is curious about what another writer does
* someone else working [Project Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/about/)
* anyone interested in the process of problem solving
* a bioinformatics student looking into technical writing as a career
