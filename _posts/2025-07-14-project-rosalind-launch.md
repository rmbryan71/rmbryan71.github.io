# Introduction
[Project Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/about/) is a set of bioinformatics problems that I'm going to attempt to solve while documenting the process here.

# Ground Rules
1. **AI Use**: I'm going to use AI to help me make images and code because coding is the least interesting part of this process for me. I'm _not_ going to use AI for problem solving or text writing, because those are the parts I want to get better at through practice.
2. **Answers**: I'm not going to post the answers in code because I don't want to tempt anyone to copy and paste my answers.
3. **Language**: I'm probably going to use Python for most of these problems because I'm basically familiar with how Python works.
# Getting Started
I've already solved 37 of these problems. You can see my [progress](https://rosalind.info/users/rmbryan/). I'll be re-working these and writing blog posts about them. Then I'll move on to solving new problems and writing about them.
