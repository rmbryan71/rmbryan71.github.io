# Introduction
[Project Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/about/) is a set of bioinformatics problems that I'm going to attempt to solve 
while documenting the process here.
# Ground Rules
1. **AI Use**: I'm not going to use any AI tools for this project because I'm doing this to learn how to document the problem-solving process.
2. **Posting Code**: I'm sharing my code repository [here](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind).
3. **Language**: Mostly [Python](https://www.python.org/).
# Getting Started
I've solved 37 of these problems already. 
You can see my [progress](https://rosalind.info/users/rmbryan/). 
I'll be re-working these and writing blog posts about them. 
Then I'll move on to solving new problems and writing about them.
