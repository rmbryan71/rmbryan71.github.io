# Ice Cream Barge
### (340-word microfiction)

In World War Two, I served on a ship we called the USS Barrel. It was a concrete-hulled monstrosity that the Navy called a BRL (Barge, Refrigerated, Large). We had massive refrigerated rooms for meat and vegetables from back home, but our real claim to fame was that we could make 10 gallons of ice cream in seven minutes. It's misleading to say that without clarifying that we didn't make ice cream as our grandparents did, with cream and a lot of mixing. We used powder from the national dairy and just added water.

It was easy duty. We never got shot at or captured. We had to work odd shifts, but nobody complained. I should say, nobody but PFC Earl Gravits complained. Gravits was a loud-mouth, and swore constantly. He took personal offense to being stationed on the USS Barrel, saying it was beneath his status. "Duty not befitting a fighting man like myself.", he repeated often.

When we left Naval Base Ulithi after being stationed there for a few weeks, we got a new order. We were to add one box of "ICA 4 - Ice Cream Additive" to every batch. It was white powder that looked exactly like the stuff from the dairy. My shift was being re-trained when Gravits spoke up out of turn. "I'll be damned if I'll add this rat poison or whatever it is." We didn't have any MPs on board, but when Gravits took a swing at an officer who was trying to talk sense to him, well, we went and got some MPs.

Of course, things went downhill from there, but we got all our news second hand. Anyway, my whole life, whenever I started to get too hard on myself, I'd think of Gravits and, "Hey, at least I didn't get court-martialed off an ice cream barge."
