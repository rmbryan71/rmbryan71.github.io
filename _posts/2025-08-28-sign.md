[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/sign/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A positive integer nâ‰¤6

> **Return**: The total number of signed permutations of length n, followed by a list of all such permutations.

<!--break-->

# Required reading
None.

# Restate the problem
 A signed permutation of length n is an ordering of the first n positive integers in which each integer is then provided with either a positive or negative sign.

# Solution steps
First, I made a two-element list for each number up to six like this:

```python
list1 = [-1, 1]
list2 = [-2, 2]
list3 = [-3, 3]
list4 = [-4, 4]
list5 = [-5, 5]
list6 = [-6, 6]
```

Then, after I downloaded the dataset from Project Rosalind to see how many numbers I needed to include, I built a list of the list products for those numbers. In my case, I needed the first three, so I used:

```python
firstlist = list(product(list1, list2, list3))
```

Finally, I made a second list with all the permutations of every item in the first list.

```python
secondlist = []
for item in firstlist:
    secondlist.append(list(permutations(item)))
```
