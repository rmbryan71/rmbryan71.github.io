[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/fibd/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Positive integers n≤100 and m≤20.

> **Return**: The total number of pairs of rabbits that will remain after the n-th month if all rabbits live for m months.

# Restate the problem
This is a rabbit population model similar to [fibd](https://www.robertbryan.net/2025/07/25/fib.html). The difference here is that every pair of rabbits has a generation of two offspring every month until they die after _m_ months.

# Solution steps
My first challenge was to keep track of the rabbit population history so that I could go back and account for the correct number of rabbits dying of old age.

To do that, created a [Python list](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) where each element in the list is the population of rabbit pairs for a given generation.
I knew the population of rabbit pairs for the first two generations, so I filled them in as the first values. Python's [counting from zero](https://python.pdxdev.com/lists/do-lists-in-python-start-at-0/)
often confuses me when I try to refer to items in a list by their index, so I added a zero generation at the beginning.

>         history = [0, 1, 1]

Then, I got stuck trying to calculate all the list indices from the beginning. After considerable struggle, I realized that it's much easier to calculate them based on how far they are from _end_ of the list, so I read [this](https://www.askpython.com/python/list/negative-indexing) to learn about negative list indexing in Python.

Next, I realized that there's nothing special about the rabbit population before rabbits start dying, so in that case it's just:

```python
if i < m:
    history.append(history[-1] + history[-2])
```
In the generation when rabbits start dying of old age, only that first, oldest pair of rabbits dies, so:

```python
if i == m:
    history.append(history[-1] + history[-2] - 1)
```

... and the complicated case is when i < m, so I need to figure out how many pairs of rabbits to kill off.

```python
if i > m:
    history.append((history[-1] + history[-2]) - history[-m-1])
```

These three statements worked to give me correct answer.

# Python concepts
Learning about the [negative indexing mechanism](https://www.askpython.com/python/list/negative-indexing) was the key to me solving
this problem, although I still think it's possible to calculate the indexes from the start of the list, the code I have works.

# Bioinformatics concepts
One common theme in bioinformatics is building computational models for living systems like reproducing rabbits and the likelihood of genetic outcomes over generations. There is a fascinating paper on the topic [here](https://www.biophysics.org/Portals/0/BPSAssets/Articles/galina.pdf).
