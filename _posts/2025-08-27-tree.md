[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/tree/) problem asks:

> **Given**:  A positive integer n (nâ‰¤1000) and an adjacency list corresponding to a graph on n nodes that contains no cycles.

> **Return**: The minimum number of edges that can be added to the graph to produce a tree.

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get a number _n_ less than 1,000, and a list of all the edges of a graph with _n_ nodes. There are no graph [cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph) in the list of edges.
The graph with _n_ nodes is incomplete, meaning that there is no path that connects every node with every other node.
I need to return the smallest number of edges that can be added to complete the graph.

# Solution steps
First, I struggled to think of how I could possibly make any progress on this until I read Shouryanpatil's code and realized that nothing about the specific edges given in the problem matter at all. The only relevant fact is that the number of edges on a tree with n vertices is always n-1.

I wrote a [function](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/tree.py) to count the number of edges, subtracted from the number of vertices and got the correct result on my first submission.
