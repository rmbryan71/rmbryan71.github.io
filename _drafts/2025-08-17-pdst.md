[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/pdst/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A collection of n (n≤10) DNA strings s1,…,sn of equal length (at most 1 kbp). 

> **Return**: The matrix D corresponding to the p-distance dp on the given strings.

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get up to 10 DNA strings. I need to construct a table of the p-distance between each string and every other string. p-distance is the proportion of symbols that are different between the two strings.

# Solution steps
First, I wrote a little p_dist function that returns the proportion of symbols that are different between two strings.
Next, I wrote two nested loops to print the p_dist for every possible combination of strings in a table.
Then, I changed my nested loops so that they wrote to a file instead of printing in the console.
My solution returned the correct result for the sample dataset, so I downloaded a test dataset and tried my solution with that.
My first attempt failed because I did not rename my sample dataset before downloading the real dataset, but once I did that, my second attempt succeeded.
I'm the first person to solve this challenge today. 2,653 people have solved this challenge before me. This challenge took me approximately 30 minutes to solve.
