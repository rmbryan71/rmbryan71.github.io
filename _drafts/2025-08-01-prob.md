[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/prob/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A DNA string s of length at most 100 bp and an array A containing at most 20 numbers between 0 and 1.

> **Return**: An array B having the same length as A in which B[k] represents the common logarithm of the probability that a random string constructed with the GC-content found in A[k] will match s exactly.

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get a short DNA string, _s_, and an array, _A_, of up to 20 numbers between zero and one.

I need to return an array, _B_, the same length as A. Each number in B needs to be the common logarithm of the probability that a random string with the same GC-content as the corresponding value in _A_, will match _s_ exactly.

What are the chances that a random string with a given GC-content will match _s_ exactly?
# Solution steps
First, I can break down the chance that the whole string _s_ gets randomly generated into the product of all the chances that a single base pair will get randomly generated based on a given GC-content.
