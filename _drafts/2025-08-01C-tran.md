[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/tran/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Two DNA strings s1 and s2 of equal length (at most 1 kbp).

> **Return**: The transition/transversion ratio R(s1,s2).

# Required reading

2. [Transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics))
3. [Transversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversion)
4. [Transition/transversion ratio](https://rosalind.info/glossary/transitiontransversion-ratio/)

# Restate the problem
I need to find everywhere that s1 and s2 are different. For each difference, I need to figure out if it's a transition or a transversion. I need to return the ratio of transitions to transversions
