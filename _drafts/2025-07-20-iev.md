[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/iev/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Six non-negative integers, each of which does not exceed 20,000. 

> **Return**: The expected number of offspring displaying the dominant phenotype in the next generation, under the assumption that every couple has exactly two offspring.

# First impression
I've read this challenge six times and I'm still not sure what it's asking.

I read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) about Expected Values, twice.

I read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution) about uniform random variables, twice.

The Given section of the problem looks a little bit like my solution to [a previous problem](https://rosalind.info/problems/iprb/). I'll start from there.

# Solution steps
First, I read in the six integers from the file, then I build a set that represents all the couples in the population:
> couples = a * [("AA", "AA")] + b * [("AA", "Aa")] + c * [("AA", "aa")] + d * [("Aa", "Aa")] + e * [("Aa", "aa")] + f * [("aa", "aa")]

I used the same process to solve this challenge as I used to solve [iprb](https://rosalind.info/problems/iprb/).

Unexpectedly, when I uploaded my answer to the dataset I was given, the result came back "Wrong!"
My code looks right. I get an answer that looks right, but somehow, something is wrong.

I reviewed my code thoroughly several times, but didn't find anything that looked wrong.

I downloaded a new dataset, ran my code again, uploaded the new results, still wrong.

Then I realized that I didn't need to do the [("AA", "Aa")] steps. All I needed was:
```
def iev(a, b, c, d, e, f):
    return str(a*2 + b*2 + c*2 + d*1.5 + e)
```

# Conclusion
I still can't figure out why my first solution didn't work, while the simpler code does work. They should do the same thing.
