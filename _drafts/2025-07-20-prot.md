[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/prot/) problem asks:

> **Given**: An RNA string s corresponding to a strand of mRNA (of length at most 10 kbp).

> **Return**: The protein string encoded by s.

# First impression
I'm going to need to do [some reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code#RNA_codon_table) to learn about the RNA Codon table.

First, I'm going to check biopython to see if they have a function that translates RNA strings into proteins. 
If that doesn't work, I predict that I'm going to parse the input RNA string into 3-character "words", then do a [lookup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table) against the codon table, then 
concatenate the results into a protein string.

# Solution steps
First, I write a stub program that just reads in the RNA sequence and writes it to an answer file. (Why?)

[This](https://biopython.org/docs/latest/api/Bio.Seq.html#Bio.Seq.SequenceDataAbstractBaseClass.translate) function in the Bio.Seq module sounds like it should do the trick.

I found the specifics of how to work with Bio.Seq.translate() [here](https://biopython.org/docs/latest/api/Bio.Seq.html#Bio.Seq.translate).

Bio.Seq.translate() uses an asterisk as the stop symbol by default, but there's a parameter, stop_symbol, that I can set to ''.

My full solution code is [here](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/prot.py).

# Conclusion
Finding the right function in biopython was the only difficult step here.
