# Restate the problem
I'm going to get two strings. I need to return the longest substring that appears in both. The characters in the substring do not need to appear consecutively in the super-stings. This is different from the longest common substring problem because the subsequences do not occupy consecutive positions in the original sequences.

# Solution steps
The Wikipedia page included [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) for a two-step solution. First, a two-dimensional array is built to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences of all the subsequences of s and t.
Then, a backtrack function uses the two-dimensional array to read out the longest common subsequence.
