[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/motz/) problem asks:

> **Given**: An RNA string s of length at most 300 bp.

> **Return**: The total number of noncrossing matchings of basepair edges in the bonding graph of s, modulo 1,000,000.

# Restating the problem
Given an RNA strand up to 300 bp long, _s_, I need to count the total number of ways to match basepair edges that don't cross in the bonding graph of _s_. This is going to be an extremely large number, so I'm to return my result modulo 1,000,000.

# Solution steps
First, this problem is similar to [the Catalan numbers problem](https://rosalind.info/problems/cat/), where we had to find the number of noncrossing matches that were complete, meaning they included all nodes. This problem doesn't have that requirement. Here, every noncrossing matching counts, even the case where no base pairs match.

I started by copying my code from the Catalan problem, [here](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/cat.py).
