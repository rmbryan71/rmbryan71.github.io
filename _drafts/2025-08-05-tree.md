[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/tree/) problem asks:

> **Given**:  A positive integer n (n≤1000) and an adjacency list corresponding to a graph on n nodes that contains no cycles.

> **Return**: The minimum number of edges that can be added to the graph to produce a tree.

1. [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)
2. [Graph connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory))

4. [Internal node](https://rosalind.info/glossary/internal-node/)
5. [Graph cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph)

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get a number _n_ less than 1,000, and a list of all the edges of a graph with _n_ nodes. There are no graph [cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph) in the list of edges.
The graph with _n_ nodes is incomplete, meaning that there is no path that connects every node with every other node.
I need to return the smallest number of edges that can be added to complete the graph.
