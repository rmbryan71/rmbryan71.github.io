[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/tree/) problem asks:

> **Given**:  A positive integer n (nâ‰¤1000) and an adjacency list corresponding to a graph on n nodes that contains no cycles.

> **Return**: The minimum number of edges that can be added to the graph to produce a tree.

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get a number n less than 1,000, and a list of all the edges of a graph with n nodes. There are no graph [cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph) in the list of edges.
The graph with n nodes is incomplete, meaning that there is no path that connects every node with every other node.
I need to return the smallest number of edges that can be added to complete the graph.
