[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/lia/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Two positive integers k (k≤7) and N (N≤2k). In this problem, we begin with Tom, who in the 0th generation has genotype Aa Bb. Tom has two children in the 1st generation, each of whom has two children, and so on. Each organism always mates with an organism having genotype Aa Bb.

> **Return**: The probability that at least N Aa Bb organisms will belong to the k-th generation of Tom's family tree (don't count the Aa Bb mates at each level). Assume that Mendel's second law holds for the factors.

# Restate the problem
I admit, this one took me a while to understand what was being asked. It's clear that A and B are [independent variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables) because the problem makes that clear twice.

If I look at Tom's offspring from his _k_ th  generation, what are the chances that at least _N_ of them are Aa Bb? 

# Solution steps
First, I read about [Punnett squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnett_square) again. Although I've heard about these, I needed to understand how they work better.

After reading up and looking at some examples, I learned that since Tom is Aa Bb and all of his mates are Aa Bb, the probability of an Aa Bb offspring in any generation is 0.25.

I spent a long time stuck at this point. I kept re-reading the problem looking for clues, and I couldn't figure out why they gave the example with the pips on the dominos because that didn't seem to relate to the problem at all.

I Googled:

> Python independent events

which led to [several](https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Fullerton_College/Math_100%3A_Liberal_Arts_Math_(Claassen_and_Ikeda)/06%3A_Probability/6.03%3A_Independent_Events_and_Conditional_Probabilities) [interesting](https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Fullerton_College/Math_100%3A_Liberal_Arts_Math_(Claassen_and_Ikeda)/06%3A_Probability/6.03%3A_Independent_Events_and_Conditional_Probabilities) [explanations](https://thirdspacelearning.com/gcse-maths/probability/independent-events/) that were essentially repetitions of the one given in the problem. I didn't feel any closer to a solution.

I was on page 57 of [this pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/~oas/SI/QM/notes/ProbabilityText.pdf) when I read about [Bernoulli random variablies](https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Queens_College/Introduction_to_Probability_and_Mathematical_Statistics/09%3A_Week_9/9.03%3A_The_Bernoulli_and_Binomial_Random_Variables) and the binomial random variable equation.

# Python concepts
Biopython doesn't have an implementation of the binomial random variable functions, so I used one from the [SciPy library](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.binom.html).
