[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/prtm/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A protein string P of length at most 1000 aa.

> **Return**: The total weight of P.

<!--Break-->

# Restate the problem
There is a [monoisotopic mass table](https://rosalind.info/glossary/monoisotopic-mass-table/) provided with the challenge.
For each protein in the string of proteins they provide, I need to look up the weight in the table and add all the weights together.

# Solution steps
Finding the right function to use
Setting the isotope mode to True
Subtracting out the water molecule
