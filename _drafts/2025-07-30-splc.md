[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/splc/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A DNA string s (of length at most 1 kbp) and a collection of substrings of s acting as introns. 

> **Return**: A protein string resulting from transcribing and translating the exons of s.

<!--Break-->

# Restate the problem
Introns don't get translated into proteins. They're going to send me a DNA string and I need to delete the introns, then translate the remaining exons into proteins.

# Solution steps
First, I read the fasta file and assigned the first DNA string to the variable "_sequence_".

Then, I iterated over the remaining DNA strings and removed them from _sequence_ using:
```python
sequence = sequence.replace(intron.seq,'')
```
Next, I translated _sequence_ into proteins using Biopython.

Finally, I removed the asterisk from the end of the translated protein by printing all but the last character with:
```python
print(sequence.translate()[:-1])
```

# Python concepts
Nothing new discovered in the process of solving this challenge. There was some [string slicing](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp), but nothing novel. 

# Bioinformatics concepts
[Introns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron) and [exons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon) are new. These are both complex topics, but all that was necessary to solve this challenge was to know that introns don't get translated and exons do.
