[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/splc/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A DNA string s (of length at most 1 kbp) and a collection of substrings of s acting as introns. 

> **Return**: A protein string resulting from transcribing and translating the exons of s.

<!--Break-->

# Restate the problem
Introns don't get translated into proteins. They're going to send me a DNA string and I need to delete the introns, then translate the remaining exons into proteins.
