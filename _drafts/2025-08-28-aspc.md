[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/aspc/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Positive integers n and m with 0≤m≤n≤2000.

> **Return**: The sum of combinations C(n,k) for all k satisfying m≤k≤n, modulo 1,000,000.

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get two integers less than 2000. I need to find the sum of all the combination equations C(n, k) where k is between or equal to the two integers I get. This is going to be an extremely large number, so I'm need to return the answer modulo 1,000,000.

# Solution steps
First, I used the formula from Wikipedia to count the number of possible combinations:
```python
def comb(n, k):
    return (fact(n) // fact(k)*fact(n - k))
```

but that returned a value much higher than the correct response for the sample dataset.

I installed the math library and used math.comb(n, k) to calculate the number of combinations and got the correct result for the sample dataset.
