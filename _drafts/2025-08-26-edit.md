# Restate the problem
Given two protein strings, I need to find the minimum number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions required to transform the first string into the second string.

# Solution steps
1. I decided to try to implement the pseudocode definition of the Wagner-Fischer algorithm from Wikipedia.
2. After struggling to properly create a fill a two-dimensional array using native Python, I decided to install NumPy and use NumPy arrays.
