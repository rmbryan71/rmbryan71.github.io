# Restate the problem
Given two protein strings, I need to find the minimum number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions required to transform the first string into the second string.

# Solution steps
1. I decided to try to implement the pseudocode definition of the Wagner-Fischer algorithm from Wikipedia.
2. After struggling to properly create a fill a two-dimensional array using native Python, I decided to install NumPy and use NumPy arrays which are easier for me to work with.
3. There were some stubborn indexing issues that took a while to work out with trial and error. The description of the Wagner-Fischer algorithm on Wikipedia has the input strings one-indexed and the matrix zero-indexed, which took me a while to implement correctly in Python, which zero-indexes everything by default.

Once the indexing issues were fixed, I got correct responses for the sample dataset on Project Rosalind as well as the example on Wikipedia.

I got a correct response on the first attempt at real data. The two strings I was given were 863 and 797 characters long. 392 edits were required to transform the first string into the second string. 

I was the first person on Project Rosalind to solve this challenge today. 1,915 people have solved this before me. This was my 52nd correct response. I spent about 90 minutes on this challenge. Nearly all of that time was spent troubleshooting the details of the indexing scheme between the given strings and the constructed matrix.
