[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/mrna/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A protein string of length at most 1000 aa.

> **Return**: The total number of different RNA strings from which the protein could have been translated, modulo 1,000,000. 

# First impression
The modulo operator is described well [here](https://rosalind.info/glossary/modular-arithmetic/) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic).

This challenge is related to [the prot problem](https://rosalind.info/problems/prot/) where we needed to get decode the protein string from the RNA string.
I don't think there's going to be a function in biopython that gives the count of all the possible RNA sequences that lead to a protein
sequence, but I'll check.

# Solution steps
I copied the RNA Codon table out of the problem statement as a [Python set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp)
because I wanted to be able to iterate over all the possible encodings.

First, I built a set of all the different frequencies of the different codons. This set answers the question, "How many different 
ways are there to encode x protein?"

I built the frequencies set by counting each different way to encode each protein:

```python
def codon_frequencies():
    frequencies = {}
    for k, v in RNA_CODON_TABLE.items():
        # print(k, v)
        if not v in frequencies:
            frequencies[v] = 0
        frequencies[v] += 1
    # print (frequencies)
    return frequencies
```

Then, for every protein in the downloaded dataset, I look the protein up in the codon_frequencies table and multiply the 
existing count of encodings by the number of different ways to encode that protein.

This number gets extremely large very quickly, so I did a 
> mod 1000000

after every protein.

# Conclusion
My solution worked as written the first time through.
Making the codon_frequencies set and iterating through the proteins, multiplying each time, was the only way I could think 
to do this.
