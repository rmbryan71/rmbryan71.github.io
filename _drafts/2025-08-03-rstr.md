[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/rstr/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A positive integer Nâ‰¤100000, a number x between 0 and 1, and a DNA string s of length at most 10 bp.

> **Return**: The probability that if N random DNA strings having the same length as s are constructed with GC-content x, then at least one of the strings equals s. 

<!--Break-->

# Required reading
None

# Restate the problem
I get an integer _N_, a float _x_ and a short DNA string, _s_.
I need to calculate the probability that the exact sequence _s_ will be generated within _N_ random strings with gc-content _x_.

# Solution steps
This is a lot like prob, so I started with that code and adjusted to the requirements of this challenge.

What took the longest time was that the attempt dataset came with a trailing line break which I needed to strip out.
