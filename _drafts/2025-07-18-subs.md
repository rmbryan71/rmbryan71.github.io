[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/subs/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Two DNA strings s and t (each of length at most 1 kbp).

> **Return**: All locations of t as a substring of s.

# First impression
[Motifs](https://rosalind.info/glossary/motif/) and [substrings](https://rosalind.info/glossary/substring/) are simple enough to understand.

This challenge is going to involve checking each character in t to see if it is the beginning of a substring, s. I get the 
feeling that this is going to be harder than it looks.

# Solution steps
First, I write an algorithm that steps through s and checks to see if it's a match for the first character in t.

Then, I learn about [slicing strings in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp).

I spent some time going down an unhelpful path using nested for statements, then realized that all I needed was:
> if (s[i:i+len(t)]) == t:
