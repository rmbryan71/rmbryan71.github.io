# Restate the problem
I'm going to get a set of DNA strings, and I need to return the shortest possible string that contains all given strings.

# Solution steps
_Personal note_: I was surprised to see that I tried and failed to solve this challenge in June 2021 and March 2022. I have no memory of these attempts.
