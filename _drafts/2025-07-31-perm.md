[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/perm/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A positive integer nâ‰¤7

> **Return**: The total number of permutations of length n, followed by a list of all such permutations (in any order).

# Restate the problem
Before putting the problem in my own words, I read:
1. [Permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation)
2. [Genome rearrangement](https://rosalind.info/glossary/genome-rearrangement/)
3. [Synteny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synteny)
4. [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)
5. [Recursion in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))

I'm going to get a number less than or equal to 7. I need to return the number of possible permutations of a list of integers as long as that number. I also need to return a set of all of those permutations.

# Solution steps
This certainly tests my new rule about not using libraries, since the [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) and [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) libraries include functions to do these two tasks.

I wrote a small, recursive program that calculates factorials. That encouraged me to try a recursive approach to generating permutations.

I wrote a simple recursive permutations function from scratch. It's very similar to the recursive factorial function. You can see the full code [here](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/perm.py).

# Python concepts
Both functions in this challenge were recursive in that they called themselves. The factorial code is easiest to understand:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
In English: For any n >= 2, return n * factorial of n - 1

The permutations function works almost the same way:
```python
def permutations(input):
    if len(input) == 0:
        return []
    if len(input) == 1:
        return [input]
    set = []
    for j in range(len(input)):
        element = input[j]
        remainder = input[:j] + input[j+1:]
        for p in permutations(remainder):
            set.append([element] + p)
    return set
```
In English: for sets longer than one, return each element combined with the permutations from all the other elements.

To write the resulting permutations to a file in the format that Project Rosalind requires, I needed to strip out all the brackets and commas with:
```python
file.write(str(perm).replace('[','').replace(']', '').replace(',',''))
```
# Problem-solving concepts
Even though I did a lot of reading about how to write recursive functions for these two tasks, actually writing the code from scratch taught me a lot more than I would have learned using the math and itertools libraries.
