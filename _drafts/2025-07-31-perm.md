[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/perm/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A positive integer nâ‰¤7

> **Return**: The total number of permutations of length n, followed by a list of all such permutations (in any order).

# Restate the problem
Before putting the problem in my own words, I read:
1. [Permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation)
2. [Genome rearrangement](https://rosalind.info/glossary/genome-rearrangement/)
3. [Synteny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synteny)

I'm going to get a number less than or equal to 7. I need to return the number of possible permutations of a list of integers as long as that number. I also need to return a set of all of those permutations.

# Solution steps
This certainly tests my new rule about not using libraries, since the [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) and [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) libraries include functions to do these two tasks.

I wrote a small, recursive program that calculates factorials.
