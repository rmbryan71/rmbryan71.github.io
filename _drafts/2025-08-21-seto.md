[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/seto/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A positive integer n (n≤20,000) and two subsets A and B of {1,2,…,n}.

> **Return**: Six sets: A∪B, A∩B, A−B, B−A, Ac, and Bc (where set complements are taken with respect to {1,2,…,n}).

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get an integer less than 20,000, _n_, and two subsets, _A_ and _B_, where both _A_ and _B_ are subsets of the counting numbers up to _n_.
I need to return these six sets:
1. The union of A and B.
2. The intersection of A and B.
3. The set difference A - B.
4. The set difference B - A.
5. The set complement of A.
6. The set complement of B.

# Solution steps
First, I struggled to read the sets out of the text file and build Python sets.
My solution is to read the lines into lists, then construct sets from the lists.

Once that was done, I used Python's native set functions to write the six required sets to a file.

My first attempt succeeded. This challenge took about an hour, with almost all of that time figuring out how to properly read the dataset from the file into sets.

I was the first person to solve this challenge today. 2,274 people solved this before me. This was my 49th correct result.

Python eval would have been helpful.
