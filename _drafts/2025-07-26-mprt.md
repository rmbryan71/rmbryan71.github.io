[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/mprt/) problem asks:

> **Given**: At most 15 UniProt Protein Database access IDs.

> **Return**: For each protein possessing the N-glycosylation motif, output its given access ID followed by a list of locations in the protein string where the motif can be found.

# Restate the problem
This is the reading I did so that I could restate the problem:
1. [Protein domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain) (x2)
2. [Protein families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family)
3. [Chimeric protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein)
4. [Chimeric genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimeric_gene)
5. [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/)
6. [UniProt accession numbers](https://www.uniprot.org/help/accession_numbers)
7. [N-linked glycosylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-linked_glycosylation)

I'm going to get a list of protein IDs. First, I need to download the records for these proteins from UniProt. Then I need to go through the protein sequences and find every place where there is a match for "N{P}[ST]{P}" where {P} means "not P" and [ST] means "either S or T".

# Solution steps
Fortunately, as they have done with every challenge so far, Project Rosalind provides me with a sample dataset and a sample output. I'll use this as a guide while I problem-solve. If I can write a solution that is correct for the sample dataset, it's likely that it will be correct for the challenge dataset that I download when solving the problem.

Two of the example protein IDs in the sample dataset are 404 at UniProt!

# Python concepts
regex
turns out I didn't need regex, time wasted

# Bioinformatics concepts
There is a database of proteins
[Glycosylation](https://wellwisp.com/what-is-n%E2%80%91glycosylation/) = 'N-glycosylation is a biochemical process where a carbohydrate, known as an oligosaccharide or glycan, is attached to a nitrogen atom in a protein, specifically at the asparagine residue. This modification is crucial for the structure and function of many proteins in eukaryotic cells.'

# Problem solving concepts
not being able to find proteins by ID at uniprot
![uniprot-demerged.png](../assets/uniprot-demerged.png)
figured out new naming convention for proteins
still failed to find proteins
finally got a list of proteins that were all found and FAILED
I wrote a comma-delimited list of sites instead of space delimited

# Conclusion
I did not take me very long to _conceptually_ solve this challenge.

It took me a **very long time** to submit a correct answer.
