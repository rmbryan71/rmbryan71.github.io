# Restate the problem
I'm going to set a DNA strands that fall into two groups. First, correct reads that are confirmed by being in the dataset more than once, either directly or via reverse complement. Second, incorrect reads, which only appear in the dataset one time. For each incorrect read, there is a correct read that requires exactly one character change to match the incorrect read. I need to return each incorrect read with its corresponding correct read.

# Solution steps
First, I wrote a function to find all the incorrect reads by removing every string that appeared more than one time either directly or as a reverse complement.

Then, I wrote a function to find all the correct reads by removing all the incorrect reads from the list.

Next, I wrote a function to find the match each incorrect read with a correct read or its reverse complement that differed by exactly one character.

My answers were incorrect for the sample dataset, so I submitted two incorrect answers in order to unlock the "Questions" section, where I got the hint that incorrect responses couldn't map to other incorrect responses.

I was the second person to solve this challenge today. 2,410 people have solved this before me. This challenge took me approximately 1.5 hours of focused work, as well as one day of thinking about the edge cases away from the keyboard. This is my 48th successful result.
