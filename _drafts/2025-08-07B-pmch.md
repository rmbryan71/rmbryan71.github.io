[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/pmch/) problem asks:

> **Given**: An RNA string s of length at most 80 bp having the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U' and the same number of occurrences of 'C' as 'G'.

> **Return**: The total possible number of _perfect_ matchings of basepair edges in the bonding graph of s.

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get an RNA string up to 80 characters long with the same number of A's as U's and the same number of C's as G's.
I need to return the count of perfect matchings possible.

# Solution steps
Wrote the recurrence relation equation from the challenge explanation:
> return ((2*n)-1) * x(n - 1)

I tried to get the correct sample output given the sample dataset, but failed.

I realized that there are two disconnected graphs at work here. The A-U graph and the C-G graph. The total number of pairings is the number of A-U pairings times the number of C-G pairings.

The number of A-U graphs is A!
The number of C-G graphs is C!
