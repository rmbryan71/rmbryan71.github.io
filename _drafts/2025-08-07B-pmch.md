[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/pmch/) problem asks:

> **Given**: An RNA string s of length at most 80 bp having the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U' and the same number of occurrences of 'C' as 'G'.

> **Return**: The total possible number of _perfect_ matchings of basepair edges in the bonding graph of s.
