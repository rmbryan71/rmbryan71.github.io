[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/pper/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Positive integers n and k such that 100≥n>0 and 10≥k>0.

> **Return**: The total number of partial permutations P(n,k), modulo 1,000,000.

# Restate the problem
Reading:
1. [Partial permutations](https://rosalind.info/glossary/partial-permutation/)
2. [More partial permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_permutation) x2
3. [Combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination)

I'm going to get two numbers n and k. N is the size of a population. k is the number of items I choose out of that population per iteration. I need to count the number of different ways I can choose k items out of a population n.
# Solution steps
In reading the Wikipedia article on combinations, I saw a formula to calculate the number of 5-card poker hands possible from a standard 52-card deck.

I wrote two different implementations of "n choose k" algorithms, but neither gave the correct answer for the sample dataset.

I installed the scipy library and used the perms method.
