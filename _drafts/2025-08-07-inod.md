[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/inod/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A positive integer _n_ (3≤n≤10000).

> **Return**: The number of internal nodes of any unrooted binary tree having _n_ leaves.

# Required reading
1. [Binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)
2. [Arborescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborescence_(graph_theory))
3. [Rooted tree](https://rosalind.info/glossary/rooted-tree/)
4. [Unrooted binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrooted_binary_tree)

# Restate the problem
Given the number of leaves in an unrooted binary tree, return the number of internal nodes.

# Solution steps
In reading the Wikipedia page on [unrooted binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrooted_binary_tree), I read this snippet:
> In an unrooted binary tree with n leaves, there will be n − 2 internal nodes...

Is it possible that the answer is simply n-2 for any given n?

I don't even need to write any code to figure that out. I just download the dataset from Project Rosalind and return n-2 as the answer.

Yes! That works. Here's a first. I've solved a challenge with no code at all.
