[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/prsm/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A positive integer _n_ followed by a collection of _n_ protein strings _s1_, _s2_, ..., _sn_ and a multiset _R_ of positive numbers (corresponding to the complete spectrum of some unknown protein string).

> **Return**: The maximum multiplicity of RâŠ–S[sk] taken over all strings sk, followed by the string sk for which this maximum multiplicity occurs (you may output any such value if multiple solutions exist).

# Restating the problem
Given a set of proteins strings and a complete spectrum, I need to calculate which protein string in the list can appear the greatest number of ways in the given spectrum.
