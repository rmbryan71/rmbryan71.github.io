title:  "Creating a Character Table"

[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/ctbl/) problem asks:

> **Given**: An unrooted binary tree _T_ in Newick format for at most 200 species taxa.

> **Return**: A character table having the same splits as the edge splits of _T_. The columns of the character table should encode the taxa ordered lexicographically; the rows of the character table may be given in any order. Also, for any given character, the particular subset of taxa to which 1s are assigned is arbitrary.

# Restating the problem
Given an unrooted binary tree in Newick format, I need to produce a character table that matches the given table. A character table lists a 0 or a 1 for each taxon based on whether it has a character responsible for a phylogenic split.
