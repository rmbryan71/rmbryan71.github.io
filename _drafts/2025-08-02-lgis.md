[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/lgis) problem asks:

> **Given**: A positive integer n≤10000 followed by a permutation π of length n.

> **Return**: A longest increasing subsequence of π, followed by a longest decreasing subsequence of π.

# Restate the problem
I'm going to get a number, n, followed by a list of n numbers in a random but specific order. I need to return the longest sequence of numbers from the order they were given where each number is greater than the previous number.
Then, I need to do the same process in reverse, finding the longest decreasing sequence of numbers from the order they were given.

# Solution steps
I read the [pseudocode algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence#Efficient_algorithms) in the wikipedia article several times to try to understand how it worked.
I found an algorithm on the wikipedia talk page that includes a python solution which I studied in depth.
