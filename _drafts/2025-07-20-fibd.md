[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/fibd/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Positive integers n≤100 and m≤20.

> **Return**: The total number of pairs of rabbits that will remain after the n-th month if all rabbits live for m months.

# First impression
I'm going to start with my solution to [fibd](https://www.robertbryan.net/2025/07/19/fib.html), since they're so similar.

It seems like it might be a simple matter of updating the code to account for the dying rabbits.

# Solution steps
My code from [fibd](https://www.robertbryan.net/2025/07/19/fib.html) wasn't helpful, so I started again from scratch after realizing
that I needed to keep track of the history of the rabbit population so that I could go back and account for the correct
number of rabbits dying of old age.

I created a [Python list](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) where each element in the list is the population of rabbit pairs for a given generation.
I knew the population of rabbit pairs for the first two generations, so I filled them in as the first values. Python's [counting from zero](https://python.pdxdev.com/lists/do-lists-in-python-start-at-0/)
often confuses me when I try to refer to items in a list by their index, so I added a zero generation at the beginning.

>         history = [0, 1, 1]

Then, I got sidetracked trying to calculate all the list indices from the beginning. It's much easier to calculate them based 
on how far they are from end of the list, so I read [this](https://www.askpython.com/python/list/negative-indexing) to learn about negative list indexing in Python.

Next, I realized that there's nothing special about the rabbit population before rabbits start dying, so in that case it's just:

```python
if i < m:
    history.append(history[-1] + history[-2])
```
In the generation when rabbits start dying of old age, only that first, oldest pair of rabbits dies, so:

```python
if i == m:
    history.append(history[-1] + history[-2] - 1)
```

... and the complicated case is when i < m, so I need to figure out how many pairs of rabbits to kill off.

```python
if i > m:
    history.append((history[-1] + history[-2]) - history[-m-1])
```

# Conclusion
Learning about the [negative indexing mechanism](https://www.askpython.com/python/list/negative-indexing) was the key to me solving
this problem, although I still think it's possible to calculate the indexes from the start of the list, the code I have works
so I'm not going to spend time figuring out other ways to solve the same problem.
