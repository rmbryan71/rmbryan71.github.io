[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/iprb/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Three positive integers _k_, _m_, and _n_, representing a population containing k+m+n organisms: k individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, m are heterozygous, and n are homozygous recessive.

> **Return**: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.

# First impression
Finally, a math problem!

This graphic from Project Rosalind seems like it holds the key to calculating the answer.

The system gets two [alleles](https://rosalind.info/glossary/allele/) from each member in _k_, one from each member in _m_, and none from each member in _n_.

I also think the hint is going to come in handy:
