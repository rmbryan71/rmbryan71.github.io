[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/sort/) problem asks:

> **Given**: Two permutations π and γ, each of length 10.

> **Return**: The reversal distance drev(π,γ), followed by a collection of reversals sorting π into γ.

# Restating the problem
I get two permutations of the integers from 1 to 10 inclusive. I need to return the minimum number of subset reversals required to transform the first permutation into the second. Then I need to return the list of indexes that define the subset that need to be reversed to accomplish the transformation.

# Solution steps
I solved the first part of the problem already in [Reversal Distance](https://rosalind.info/problems/rear/).
I started by copying my code from [here](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/rear.py), then I made a few changes to fit the code to this challenge.

My previous code worked to return the minimum number of reversals required. Next, I need to keep track of which indexes get reversed to accomplish that optimal transformation.
