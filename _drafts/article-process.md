I generally follow these steps for each problem-article pair that I write:
# Solving
1. Choose the next problem from the [tree view](https://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/).
2. Create an article in the _drafts folder by refactor->copy file on the post-template.md.
3. Fill in the template with information from the problem.
4. Restate the problem.
5. Create a python file and start coding.
6. Keep notes in the article file of what I'm trying and how it works.
7. Iterate until the problem gets solved.
8. Write the Solution steps based on the notes.

# Writing
1. Explain any Python concepts used in the solution
2. Be comprehensive, really explain what got used and how
3. Use images and graphics whenever possible
4. Remember this is the point of the whole exercise, good writing
5. Explain the Bioinformatics concepts introduced in this problem
6. Link to online resources

# Publishing
Publish the oldest articles first, and don't publish more than one per day.
1. Let the article sit in drafts for at least 24 hours, revise as needed.
2. Proof read, think about how the article could be improved, revise.
3. When satisfied, change the date on the article header to today's date
4. Move to the _posts folder and commit to publish.
