I generally follow these steps for each problem-article pair that I write:
# Solving
1. Choose the next problem from the [tree view](https://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/).
2. Create an article in the _drafts folder by refactor->copy file on the post-template.md.
3. Fill in the template with information from the problem.
4. Write first impressions.
5. Create a python file and start coding.
6. Keep notes in the article file of what I'm trying and how it works.
7. Iterate until the problem gets solved.
8. Write the article based on the notes.

# Publishing
Publish the oldest articles first, and don't publish more than one per day.
1. Let the article sit in drafts for at least 24 hours, revise as needed.
2. Proof read, think about how the article could be improved, revise.
3. When satisfied, change the date on the article header to today's date
4. Move to the _posts folder and commit to publish.
