I generally follow these steps for each problem-article pair that I write:
1. Choose the next problem from the [tree view](https://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/).
2. Create an article in the _drafts folder using the post-template.md.
3. Fill in the template with information from the problem.
4. Write first impressions.
5. Create a python file and start coding.
6. Keep notes in the article file of what I'm trying and how it works.
7. Iterate until the problem gets solved.
8. Write the article based on the notes.
9. Let the article sit in drafts for at least 24 hours, revise as needed.
10. Move to the _posts folder and publish.
