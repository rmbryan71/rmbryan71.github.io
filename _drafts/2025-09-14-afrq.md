[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/afrq/) problem asks:

> **Given**: An array A for which A[k] represents the proportion of homozygous recessive individuals for the k-th Mendelian factor in a diploid population. Assume that the population is in genetic equilibrium for all factors.

> **Return**: An array B having the same length as A in which B[k] represents the probability that a randomly selected individual carries at least one copy of the recessive allele for the k-th factor.

# Restating the problem
For each probability of homozygous recessive individuals in the given array, I need to calculate the probability of recessive allele carriers.

# Solution steps
I coded the equation for recessive allele carriers like this:

```python
    for item in proportion_recessives:
        q = item ** 0.5
        p = max(roots([1, 2*q, q**2-1]))
        probs.append((2*p*q) + (q ** 2))
```

This returned a correct answer on the first attempt.

reword:
```text
The Hardy-Weinberg Principle states that (p^2) + (2pq) + (q^2) = 1

Here we are given q^2, and needs to find 2pq + q^2 (or alternatively 1 - p^2).

By noting that p = 1 - q (or solving the quadratic equation for p), one findes that the answer is given by 2 * (1-q) * q + q^2.
```
