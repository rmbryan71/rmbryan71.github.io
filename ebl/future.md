# Change log
January 9, 2026 v 0.01 - initial release
# Introduction
These are the features I want to develop later
- Once roster moves get automated, they should be available daily.
- Roster move attempts can specify multiple target players to add. If the top player isn't available, other players can be considered in order.
- Every way a batter can reach base should be counted. Catcher’s interference. Errors. Hit by pitch. Dropped third strike. Fan interference. Fielder's choice? Maybe.
- During the auction, it would be nice to have a list of available players that haven't been auctioned off yet so that we can see who's available.
- Provide a 1-man disabled list for each team.
