# Introduction
These are the features I want to develop later in rough order of priority:
1. The auction mechanics could be handled entirely within the system so that the Zoom call becomes optional.
2. Once roster moves get automated, they should be available daily.
2. Roster move attempts can specify multiple target players to add.  If the top player isn't available, other players can be considered in order.
4. During the auction, it would be nice to have a list of available players that haven't been auctioned off yet so that we can see who's available.
6. Provide a 1-man disabled list for each team.
7. Every way a batter can reach base should be counted.
   8. Catcher’s interference. 
   9. Error. 
   10. Hit by pitch.
   11. Dropped third strike. 
   12. Fan interference.
   13. Fielder's choice? Maybe.
8. Use GitHub issues to let people vote on which future features they would like to see most.
