# Introduction
This is where I document how information moves in the Experimental Baseball League.
# Current state
After beginning with text rendered to PDF, I've moved to:
1. League content is in [GitHub](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rmbryan71.github.io), served with [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) and [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) through [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) to [our website](https://www.robertbryan.net/ebl.html).
2. Editing content and synchronizing with GitHub with [PyCharm Community Edition (CE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
3. An "Experimental Baseball League" label in Gmail that I use to :bcc owners about updates.
# Future
1. All comms should be clearly marked as either "Information only" or "Action required"
   2. There should never be "Action required"
2. Optional group chat
2. Feedback button on web pages
3. Opt-in to event-driven comms:
   4. Weekly scores are posted
   5. Players join or leave the Phillies
   6. Roster moves in our league
   7. Standout performances by players
8. Comms for non-owner spectators
9. Handle comms in the league system without gmail
