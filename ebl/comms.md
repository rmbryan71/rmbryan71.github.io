# Change log
January 9, 2026 v 0.01 - initial release
# Introduction
Currently, I'm editing a single, local text file which I render as a version-specific PDF and manually upload to my website. Then I send links to owners by text message and email.
# Requirements for next iteration:
1. Version control through git
2. Serve content as a web page, not PDF
3. Let people navigate to an Experimental Baseball League landing page from robertbryan.net
4. Serve multiple pages from the landing page
5. email people when there are significant changes
# Plan:
1. Move content into PyCharm
	1. **Blocker**: My free version of PyCharm doesn't support the HTML editing tools from IntelliJ.
	   I could code the HTML by hand.
	   I could get a different editor.
   2. **Decision**: Code the HTML by hand for now. Get a better editor later.
2. Synchronize through github
3. Create Experimental Baseball League landing page
4. Add Experimental Baseball League link to robertbryan.net homepage
5. Publish
6. Test
	1. Technically works, but looks like trash.
	2. I need to figure out how to use the github pages engine correctly so that it applies formatting like in the blog posts.
   3. This is happening now.
7. Add other pages
   1. Happening now
8. Put links to other pages on landing page
9. Publish
10. Test
