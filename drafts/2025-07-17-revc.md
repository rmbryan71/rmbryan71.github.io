title:  "Complementing a Strand of DNA"

[This](https://rosalind.info/problems/revc/) problem asks:

> **Given**: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.

> **Return**: The reverse complement s'c of s.

# First impression
There are many ways to write a reverse complement function from scratch in Python.

One particularly clever way of getting this done is:

```aiignore
st = "AAAACCCGGT"
st = st.replace('A', 't').replace('T', 'a').replace('C', 'g').replace('G', 'c').upper()[::-1]
print st
```

However, I'm not a programmer, and I'm not doing these exercises to get better at Python.

# Biopython
Instead, I'm going to leave the programming to professionals and focus on problem solving and technical writing.
Biopython is a massive library of tools for a wide variety of computational molecular biology tasks. It also happens to be
[expertly documented](https://biopython.org/docs/latest/).

I'm going to take full advantage of these tools because they're far more advanced and capable than anything I could build myself.
Biopython has a function that returns the reverse complement of a DNA strand, so I'm going to use that.

# Solution step
This is a one-step path. I find the [right tool in Biopython](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.Seq.html#Bio.Seq.Seq.reverse_complement) and use it.
You can see my code [here](https://github.com/rmbryan71/rosalind/blob/main/solution-code/revc.py).

# Conclusion
Even though it's early in the project, this challenge helps me set a direction. Instead of writing my own tools,
I'm going to use the tools the experts use.
