Tue Sep 29 07:19:11 EDT 2020 : Walked in Arden Woods from Borders to Ann's, then back along the green.  
Drier today, warm, 69 degrees, light wind, overcast.  
Leaves maybe 1% turning, not yellow or gold, but just slightly lighter green.  
Creek is low, ground is drying out, but there's heavy rain in the forecast for today.  
The house on the creek at the end of Ann's drive has had the garage roof smashed in by a falling tree covered with a tarp for some time.  
This is a wonderful time of the year for walking in the woods in the morning, my favorite of the whole year.
